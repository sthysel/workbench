# Simple heavy mobile workbench
## Assembly of a very simple wood mobile workbench

Old Jarrah rescued from a delapilated veranda was used for some of the benches, pine posts for the rest.
Jarrah is hard and heavy, a beatifull wood, makes for a fine solid bench.

The final product in light duty use

## Screwing
Sturdy coach screws to keep it together. Long clamps to keep the shape, a rubber mallet for fine adjustments.

Countersink the top screws so they don't interfere with the flat top

Long 10mm drill bit for pilot holes for the structual coach screws. Note the clever use of isolation tape to mark max drill lenght. No need to overdo it, especially in Jarrah.

## The frame
Start by assembling the frame, get it true, clamp it down, true it up using the mallet. Use a square.

Assemble the two sides first. Like above, on a flat surface. Lift them up and add the horizontal supports.
